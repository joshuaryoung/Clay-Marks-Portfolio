            <p>“Testimony” is a contemporary drama with a lean budget. It is the second installment of a
            regionally themed trilogy, proselytic in an antithetical way because it lays bare the neurosis of
            religion and its subsequent abuses. It is in fact one individual’s testimony of a gospel that does
            not elevate his soul but crushes it. Ten million Mormons will be admonished by the patriarchy to
            boycott this movie, not because the church is misrepresented but precisely because it is
            represented, and they want their secrets to remain secret, hidden behind the cloak of sacredness.</p>
            <p>ANDY FOOTHILL is just ten years old when he suggests to his Sunday school teacher in a
            Mormon church in Salt Lake City that Jesus is a fictional manifestation of someone’s
            imagination. His mother, RAELYN (40), hears about his comments later that afternoon and gives
            him twenty lashes with her wooden spoon. RaeLyn is an overstressed, sleep-deprived mother of
            ten, in the throes of chronic postpartum depression. She embraces the fatiguing chores of
            motherhood, not because she loves children, but because she feels tyrannical allegiance to her
            Savior. Much of Act One is represented in flashbacks while Andy (now ELDER FOOTHILL
            [19]) stands at a window in his dormitory room at the Missionary Training Center, mentally
            rehearsing his clandestine escape.</p>
            <p>Act Two is set in southern California, where Andy (now 25) meets and falls in love with a fellow
            Mormon named Francisca Seymour (FRANKY [25]). Andy is a tall, handsome, broad-
            shouldered descendant of the master race. He is an enigma, because emotionally he is still a little
            boy. Though Andy and Franky have much in common, her orientation is different than his. She
            was raised in Provo, but she was born in Cape Verde to parents of mixed, undocumented
            heritage. Her lineage is significant because the Mormon Church is just a few years removed from
            amending a century-enforced doctrine of Aryan supremacy founded on Brigham Young’s “curse
            of Cain.” Andy falls apart when Franky relocates to attend medical school at Texas Tech
            University. His collapse is complete when he makes an impromptu trip to Lubbock and gets his
            nose bloodied by the fists of Franky’s new lover, a woman named JUDY (25).</p>
            <p>Act Three finds Andy (now 29) back in Salt Lake, living with his widowed mother. He has
            shoulder length hair and a beard. He is a failure, both professionally and romantically. An
            Oedipal theme emerges because he replaces his prematurely deceased father (VICTOR), not as
            RaeLyn’s bed partner but as her emotional punching bag. Painfully, Andy recognizes in
            retrospect that he mimicked RaeLyn’s mistreatment of his father and that he was indeed an
            accomplice to his figurative murder.</p>
            <p>Following a chaotic affair with a Florida transplant named JULIA (25), Andy decides that he
            would be better in intimate relationships if he had a nurturing mother that he could have
            sexualized. Twenty years of due diligence have brought him to an understanding of the futility of
            his self-perpetuating struggles. God has broken promise after promise to Andy because God is an
            aberration. In fact, Andy’s God is an abusive woman. Andy must redefine his world, a process
            which begins after Franky reconnects with him and requests his DNA so that she can have a
            child. In the final scene, Andy gathers all of his temple garments, tosses them into an outdoor
            fireplace, douses them with lighter fluid, and strikes a match.
